# Response to Integration Test Request

Hi @[reviewer-name],

Thanks for the review! I absolutely have integration tests - I tested all 6 operations against a live ERPNext instance (`https://erpnext-openfn-test.jh.erpnext.com`). However, they're currently in the `tmp/` folder (gitignored) and written as OpenFn CLI job files rather than following the monorepo's Mocha/Chai pattern used by adaptors like Salesforce and Asana.

Rather than refactoring them without your input on the preferred approach, I've created a separate branch with the integration tests included so you can see exactly what was tested and how:

## üìÅ Branch with Integration Tests

**Branch:** `erpnext-with-integration-tests`
**GitHub URL:** https://github.com/rubailly/adaptors/tree/erpnext-with-integration-tests
**Compare:** https://github.com/rubailly/adaptors/compare/main...erpnext-with-integration-tests

## üß™ What's Included

### Test Coverage
All 6 operations validated against live ERPNext instance:

| Operation | Test File | Status | Duration |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| `getCount` | `test-1-getcount.js` | ‚úÖ PASS | ~957ms |
| `getList` | `test-2-getlist.js` | ‚úÖ PASS | ~849ms |
| `create` | `test-3-create.js` | ‚úÖ PASS | ~1459ms |
| `read` | `test-4-read.js` | ‚úÖ PASS | ~649ms |
| `update` | `test-5-update.js` | ‚úÖ PASS | ~1427ms |
| `delete` | `test-6-delete.js` | ‚úÖ PASS | ~2623ms |

### Files in `packages/erpnext/tmp/`

**Test Files:**
- `test-1-getcount.js` through `test-6-delete.js` - Individual operation tests
- `run-all-tests.sh` - Test runner script for sequential execution
- `output-*.json` - Sample outputs showing successful execution results

**Documentation:**
- `TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide (336 lines)
- `DOCTYPE-STRUCTURES.md` - Discovered ERPNext data structures
- `state.json` - Test configuration template (credentials sanitized)

**Discovery Files:**
- `discover-customers.js`, `discover-items.js`, `discover-sales-orders.js`
- `customers.json`, `items.json`, `sales-orders.json` - Sample data

## üöÄ How to Run the Tests Yourself

### Option 1: Quick Review (No Execution)
Just browse the files on GitHub to see the test structure and sample outputs:
- https://github.com/rubailly/adaptors/tree/erpnext-with-integration-tests/packages/erpnext/tmp

### Option 2: Run Locally

1. **Checkout the branch:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout erpnext-with-integration-tests
   cd packages/erpnext
   ```

2. **Set up credentials:**
   Create `tmp/state.json` with your ERPNext instance credentials:
   ```json
   {
     "configuration": {
       "baseUrl": "https://your-instance.erpnext.com",
       "apiKey": "your_api_key",
       "apiSecret": "your_api_secret"
     },
     "data": {
       "customerFilters": {},
       "newCustomer": {
         "customer_name": "Test Customer",
         "customer_type": "Individual"
       },
       "existingCustomerId": "existing-customer-name",
       "updateCustomerId": "Test Customer",
       "updateCustomerData": {
         "mobile_no": "+1234567890"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Set environment variable:**
   ```bash
   export OPENFN_ADAPTORS_REPO=/path/to/your/adaptors
   ```

4. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   # All tests
   bash tmp/run-all-tests.sh

   # Or individual tests
   openfn tmp/test-1-getcount.js -ma erpnext -s tmp/state.json -o tmp/output.json
   ```

## ü§î Testing Approach

I used a **discovery-first methodology**:

1. **Phase 1 - Discovery:** Queried the live ERPNext instance to understand real data structures
2. **Phase 2 - Model:** Built test data based on actual ERPNext records
3. **Phase 3 - Execute:** Ran all 6 CRUD operations end-to-end
4. **Phase 4 - Verify:** Confirmed results in both output files and ERPNext UI

This approach ensured tests use realistic field names, valid values, and proper data structures.

## üìã Next Steps - Your Input Needed

I see other adaptors (Salesforce, Asana) include `test/integration.js` files that:
- Use Mocha/Chai test framework (not OpenFn CLI scripts)
- Import credentials from `tmp/` (gitignored)
- Have `test:integration` script in package.json
- Are excluded from main test suite

**Question:** Would you prefer me to:

### Option A: Refactor into Monorepo Pattern
- Create `test/integration.js` with Mocha/Chai tests
- Add `test:integration` script to package.json
- Follow Salesforce/Asana pattern
- Keep `tmp/` for credentials only

### Option B: Keep Documentation Only
- Remove integration test mention from PR
- Keep tests as internal validation (not in repo)
- Focus review on unit tests and code quality

### Option C: Different Approach
- Your suggestion based on reviewing the branch

## üîç Why I Initially Didn't Include Integration Tests

1. **Pattern Uncertainty:** Wasn't sure if the monorepo pattern required Mocha tests or allowed CLI-based tests
2. **External Dependencies:** Concerned about committing tests requiring live instances
3. **Credentials Management:** Wanted to avoid any risk of committing secrets
4. **Format Mismatch:** My tests were OpenFn CLI job files, not traditional unit test structure

After reviewing Salesforce/Asana adaptors, I now understand the pattern!

## ‚ú® Key Highlights

- **All operations tested** against live instance (not mocked)
- **Real data structures** discovered and validated
- **Comprehensive documentation** of testing approach
- **Sample outputs** showing successful execution
- **Authentication verified** with API Key/Secret method

Please review the branch and let me know your preference on how to proceed. I'm happy to refactor the tests into any format that works best for the monorepo!
